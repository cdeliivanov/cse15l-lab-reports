# Lab Report 1: Remote Access and FileSystem

In this report, we will review the steps needed to log into a course specific account on `ieng6`.

## Part 1 - Resetting Password
If you have not already or if you have forgotten it, you will need to reset your password. 

First find your course specific account here: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Look up your account using your general UCSD username and PID. When you log in, you should be welcomed with your name. Under "Additional Accounts" you should see a button that starts with `cse15l`.
