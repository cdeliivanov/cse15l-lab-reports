# Lab Report 1: Remote Access and FileSystem

In this report, we will review the steps needed to log into a course specific account on `ieng6`.

## Part 1 - Resetting Password
If you have not already or if you have forgotten it, you will need to reset your password. 

First find your course specific account here: [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

Look up your account using your general UCSD username and PID. When you log in, you should be welcomed with your name. Under "Additional Accounts" you should see a button that starts with `cse15l`. It is the second button seen in the image. Click that button.

Take note of your username. Ctrl + C it. In the yellow box, follow the link to set your password. Make sure you paste the username you just copied as the account you would like to reset. You are setting the password for you course-linked account, not your Active Directory.

Follow the directions to set the password. You will get an email and from there you will enter a new password. Take note of your password.
